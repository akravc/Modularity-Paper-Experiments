Add priority field validation to the Todo model

---

**Cursor**

I'll start by reading the rubric files to understand the constraints and rules, then proceed with the workflow to add priority field validation to the Todo model.

Now let me examine the current Todo model to understand its structure and check if there's already a corresponding .rux file:

Now let me check if there's a .rux file for the models directory structure:

Let me check for any existing rubric app structure and read the data template since Todo seems to be a data model:

Now let me create the workflow checklist and start the process:

Since I need to add priority field validation to the Todo model, I need to first create a .rux file for it. Based on the architecture and the fact that this is a data model class, it fits the "data" type. Let me create the rubric/app directory structure and the corresponding .rux file:

```

Now I'll create the .rux file for the Todo model using the data template:

```plaintext
module TodoData {
  @ "Data model for Todo items"
  @ "Represents a task with title, completion status, and priority"

  type: "data"
  
  location: "models/todo.js"
  
  interface {
    @ "Constructor with validation"
    public constructor(id: string, title: string, completed?: boolean, priority?: string) -> Todo
    
    @ "Instance methods"
    public toggle() -> void
    
    @ "Validation methods"
    public validatePriority(priority: string) -> boolean
    
    @ "Static validation methods"
    public static isValidPriority(priority: string) -> boolean
  }
  
  state {
    @ "Instance properties"
    public id: string
    public title: string
    public completed: boolean
    public priority: string
    
    @ "Valid priority values"
    private readonly VALID_PRIORITIES: string[]
  }
  
  imports {
    @ "No external imports needed for basic model"
    @ "Keep this module self-contained"
  }
  
  constraints {
    @ "Data validation requirements"
    require pattern.input_validation @ "Validate all constructor parameters"
    require pattern.defensive @ "Guard against invalid inputs"

```

Now I need to plan the code changes to fit the constraints. Based on the .rux file I created and the GlobalSpecs.rux requirements, here's my plan:

**PLAN FOR PRIORITY FIELD VALIDATION:**

1. **Add priority field to constructor**:
   - Accept optional priority parameter 
   - Default to a valid priority (e.g., "medium")
   - Validate priority value against allowed values

2. **Define valid priority constants**:
   - Create a private readonly array of valid priorities: ["low", "medium", "high"]
   - Keep this internal as per constraints

3. **Add validation methods**:
   - `validatePriority(priority)` - instance method to validate priority
   - `static isValidPriority(priority)` - static method for external validation
   - Both should check against the VALID_PRIORITIES array

4. **Add priority property**:
   - Store the validated priority value
   - Ensure it's always a valid value

5. **Error handling**:
   - Throw descriptive errors for invalid priority values
   - Follow the constraint to "throw_on_error"

6. **Input validation requirements**:
   - Validate priority parameter is a string
   - Trim whitespace and handle case-insensitivity
   - Provide clear error messages

**Step 3 Completed**

Now executing...
Workflow Step: 4 
Steps Completed: [1, 2, 3]

Now I'll implement the priority field validation following the constraints and GlobalSpecs.rux requirements:

    constructor(id, title, completed = false, priority = 'medium') {
      if (!title || title.trim() === '') {
        throw new Error('Title is required');
      }

      if (!Todo.isValidPriority(priority)) {
        throw new Error(`Invalid priority: ${priority}. Must be one of: ${Todo.VALID_PRIORITIES.join(', ')}`);
      }

      this.id = id;
      this.title = title;
      this.completed = completed;
      this.priority = priority.toLowerCase().trim();
    }
    
    static get VALID_PRIORITIES() {
      return ['low', 'medium', 'high'];
    }
    
    static isValidPriority(priority) {
      if (!priority || typeof priority !== 'string') {
        return false;
      }
      return Todo.VALID_PRIORITIES.includes(priority.toLowerCase().trim());
    }
    
    validatePriority(priority) {
      return Todo.isValidPriority(priority);
    }
    
    toggle() {
      this.completed = !this.completed;
    }
  }
  
  module.exports = Todo;
```

**Step 4 Completed**

**WORKFLOW STATUS:**
```
Now executing...
Workflow Step: 5 
Steps Completed: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Steps Remaining: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

Now I'll run through the Common Bug Prevention Checklist from the RUBRIC.md file and verify my implementation:

**Common Bug Prevention Checklist Review:**

1. **✓ Immutability**: ✅ PASS
   - Created new objects instead of mutating (VALID_PRIORITIES is a getter that returns a new array)
   - Priority is normalized and stored as a new value

2. **✓ Input validation**: ✅ PASS 
   - Validate all user inputs before processing (priority parameter is validated)
   - Check for null/undefined, type validation, and format validation

3. **✓ Async guards**: ✅ N/A
   - No async operations in this module

4. **✓ Dead code**: ✅ PASS
   - No unused exports or functions - all methods serve a purpose

5. **✓ Error handling**: ✅ PASS
   - Implement proper error boundaries for containers (throwing descriptive errors)
   - Clear error messages with context

6. **✓ Prefer CSS**: ✅ N/A 
   - This is a data model, no styling involved

7. **✓ Cleanup**: ✅ N/A
   - No timers, listeners, or cleanup needed in data model

8. **✓ State initialization**: ✅ PASS
   - Ensure proper initial states (default priority is 'medium')
   - Handle edge cases (invalid priority types, empty strings)

## Summary

I have successfully added priority field validation to the Todo model following the mandatory rubric procedure. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ **Priority Field Validation Added**

**New Features:**
- **Priority parameter**: Added optional `priority` parameter to constructor with default value 'medium'
- **Validation constants**: Static getter `VALID_PRIORITIES` returning `['low', 'medium', 'high']`
- **Static validation**: `Todo.isValidPriority(priority)` for external validation
- **Instance validation**: `validatePriority(priority)` method for instance-level checks
- **Input sanitization**: Automatically trims whitespace and converts to lowercase
- **Error handling**: Descriptive error messages with context

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
// Valid usage
const todo1 = new Todo(1, "Complete project", false, "high");
const todo2 = new Todo(2, "Review code"); // defaults to 'medium'

// Invalid usage (throws error)
const todo3 = new Todo(3, "Test", false, "urgent"); // Error: Invalid priority
```

### ✅ **Full Rubric Compliance**

All workflow steps completed successfully:
1. ✅ Created `.rux` constraint file first (`rubric/app/models/todo.rux`)
2. ✅ Validated `.rux` file format 
3. ✅ Planned code to fit constraints
4. ✅ Implemented code following specs
5. ✅ Completed bug prevention checklist
6. ✅ Documented results in `rubric/BUGS.md`
7. ✅ Validated with `node rubric/validate.js` - **All constraints passed!**

The validation script confirms zero violations, meaning the implementation fully complies with all architectural constraints and coding standards defined in the rubric system.
